Hi Sweety,
I have obtained a series of ultrasound images for your project.
I think that the most useful ones will be studies from the same patient – before and after treatment – so that you have a built in control for your algorithm.
I am sending  you some images now (all from the same Pt before treatment – has both longitudinal and transverse images to allow you to approx. volume)– but will mail you a USB drive with a series of de-identified images for you to work from.
If you need – I can help you draw the region of interest (ROI) around the collecting system
The kidney has two main compartments – the renal parenchyma and the renal collecting system.
Usually the collecting system – where the urine is collected – appears black on the U/S is a very small component – so creating a ratio of the parenchymal volume to collecting system volume will be very useful going forwards.
Let me know how I can help you.
Thanks sweety, love you.
Dad
