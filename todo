- create gui that allows programmer to pull up image and plot kidney outline points - maybe always ensure 10 points are plotted. this is the kidney
- create a boundary of those points. straight line? curved line? assisted by the image?
- find the area of the image inside that boundary. this is the kidney!!
- in the area of interest, find the black area. this is the collection system.
- provide the ratio of the parynchema to the collection system
